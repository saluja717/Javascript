->The do...while Loop

   The do-while loop is a variant of the while loop, 
   which evaluates the condition at the end of each loop iteration. 
   With a do-while loop the block of code executed once, and then the condition is evaluated,
  if the condition is true, the statement is repeated as long as the specified condition evaluated to is true.  
   The generic syntax of the do-while loop is:

   do {
    // Code to be executed
    }
     while(condition);
     The JavaScript code in the following example defines a loop that starts with i=1.
     It will then print the output and increase the value of variable i by 1.
     After that the condition is evaluated, and the loop will continue to run as long as the variable i is less than,
     or equal to 5.
