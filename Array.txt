JavaScript Arrays
JavaScript arrays are used to store multiple values in a single variable.

Example
var cars = ["Saab", "Volvo", "BMW"];
What is an Array?
An array is a special variable, which can hold more than one value at a time.

If you have a list of items (a list of car names, for example), storing the cars in single variables could look like this:

var car1 = "Saab";
var car2 = "Volvo";
var car3 = "BMW";
However, what if you want to loop through the cars and find a specific one? And what if you had not 3 cars, but 300?

The solution is an array!

An array can hold many values under a single name, and you can access the values by referring to an index number.

Creating an Array
Using an array literal is the easiest way to create a JavaScript Array.

Syntax:

var array_name = [item1, item2, ...];      
Example
var cars = ["Saab", "Volvo", "BMW"];
Spaces and line breaks are not important. A declaration can span multiple lines:

Example
var cars = [
  "Saab",
  "Volvo",
  "BMW"
];
Using the JavaScript Keyword new
The following example also creates an Array, and assigns values to it:

Example
var cars = new Array("Saab", "Volvo", "BMW");

Access the Elements of an Array
You access an array element by referring to the index number.

This statement accesses the value of the first element in cars:

var name = cars[0];
Example
var cars = ["Saab", "Volvo", "BMW"];
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = cars[0];

Changing an Array Element
This statement changes the value of the first element in cars:

cars[0] = "Opel";
Example
var cars = ["Saab", "Volvo", "BMW"];
cars[0] = "Opel";
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = cars[0];
