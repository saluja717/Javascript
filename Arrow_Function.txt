1. What is Arrow Function?
   
     -> Arrow functions were introduced in ES6.
        Arrow functions allow us to write shorter function syntax:
                                   BEFORE:
                                   hello = function() {
                                               return "Hello World!";
                                                      }
                                   Arrow Function:
                                   hello = () => {   
                                               return "Hello World!";
                                                       }
              It gets shorter! If the function has only one statement, and 
              the statement returns a value, you can remove the brackets and the return keyword:
  
              hello = () => "Hello World!";
                    
                     hello();
                  
                 OUTPUT-> Hello World!
