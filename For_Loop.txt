FOR LOOP IN JAVASCRIPT
->
     for - loops through a block of code a number of times
     The for loop has the following syntax:

      for (statement 1; statement 2; statement 3) {
       // code block to be executed
                         }
         Statement 1 is executed (one time) before the execution of the code block.

         Statement 2 defines the condition for executing the code block.

         Statement 3 is executed (every time) after the code block has been executed.

Example
for (i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  text += "The number is " + i + "<br>";
}
    From the example above, you can read:

Statement 1 sets a variable before the loop starts (var i = 0).

Statement 2 defines the condition for the loop to run (i must be less than 5).

Statement 3 increases a value (i++) each time the code block in the loop has been executed.
